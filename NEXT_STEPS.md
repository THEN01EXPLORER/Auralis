# 🎯 Next Steps - Submission Phase

## Current Status: APPLICATION 100% COMPLETE ✅

**Date:** November 7, 2024 (Day 7)
**Time:** 2:30 AM
**Status:** Feature-complete, ready for submission phase

---

## Phase 1: SECURE YOUR VICTORY ✅ DONE

- ✅ All code committed to GitHub (commit d4a7c65)
- ✅ Journal entry created (HACKATHON_JOURNAL.md)
- ✅ Documentation created (multiple MD files)
- ✅ All three UI states implemented and working

---

## Phase 2: CAPTURE EVIDENCE (Next - Day 7/8)

### Task 1: Take Final Screenshots
**Priority:** HIGH
**Time Required:** 15-30 minutes

Follow the `SCREENSHOT_CHECKLIST.md` to capture:
1. Empty State (welcome screen)
2. Success State (full analysis)
3. Show Fix Feature (expanded)
4. Error State (graceful failure)
5. Source Badge detail (optional)
6. Metadata detail (optional)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Start frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Task 2: Update README.md
**Priority:** HIGH
**Time Required:** 30 minutes

Add to README.md:
- Screenshots section with all captured images
- Feature highlights with visual proof
- Quick start guide
- Demo link (after deployment)

## Phase 3: DEPLOYMENT (Day 8)

### Option A: AWS Amplify (Frontend) + AWS Lambda (Backend)
**Pros:** Native AWS, good for hackathon
**Cons:** Requires AWS setup

### Option B: Vercel (Frontend) + Railway/Render (Backend)
**Pros:** Easiest, free tier available
**Cons:** Not pure AWS

### Option C: AWS EC2 (Full Stack)
**Pros:** Complete control
**Cons:** More complex setup

**Recommended:** Option B for speed, then migrate to AWS if time permits

**Deliverable:** Live URL (e.g., https://auralis.vercel.app)

---

## Phase 4: VIDEO CREATION (Day 9-10)

### Video Structure (3 minutes max):
1. **Hook (0:00-0:15):** "Smart contracts hold billions. One bug can cost millions."
2. **Problem (0:15-0:45):** Current audit tools are slow, expensive, or miss issues
3. **Solution (0:45-1:30):** Auralis - AI-powered hybrid analysis
4. **Demo (1:30-2:30):** Show all three states, highlight "Show Fix" feature
5. **Impact (2:30-3:00):** Fast, accurate, actionable security insights

### Tools:
- OBS Studio (screen recording)
- DaVinci Resolve (editing - free)
- Or simple: Loom + basic editing

### Script:
Write a tight 3-minute script focusing on:
- The problem you're solving
- Your unique approach (Hybrid = Static + AI)
- The "wow" moment (Show Fix button)
- AWS Bedrock integration
