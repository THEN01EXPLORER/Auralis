## Editing Workflow

### Step 1: Import Raw Footage
1. Open your editing software
2. Create new project: "Auralis Demo Video"
3. Import your best recording take
4. Drag video to timeline

### Step 2: Trim Beginning and End
1. Find the exact moment you start speaking
2. Cut 1-2 seconds before that
3. Find the exact moment you finish
4. Cut 1-2 seconds after that
5. **Goal:** Clean start and end, no dead air

### Step 3: Remove Mistakes (Optional)
If you made mistakes during recording:
1. Find the mistake in timeline
2. Cut before the mistake
3. Cut after you recover
4. Delete the middle section
5. Smooth the transition with a quick fade

### Step 4: Add Title Card (0:00-0:03)
**Content:**
```
🛡️ AURALIS
AI-Powered Smart Contract Security Auditor
```

**Design:**
- Black or dark blue background
- White or cyan text
- Large, bold font
- Centered
- Duration: 2-3 seconds

**How to add:**
- Most editors: Insert → Text/Title
- Position at very beginning of timeline
- Fade in/out for smooth transition

### Step 5: Add Text Overlays (Optional but Recommended)

**Key moments to highlight:**

**[0:15-0:20]** "The Problem"
- Text: "Traditional audits: Slow, Expensive, Incomplete"
- Position: Lower third
- Style: White text, semi-transparent black background

**[0:45-0:50]** "The Solution"
- Text: "Hybrid Analysis: Static + AI"
- Position: Lower third

**[1:30-1:35]** "Analysis in Progress"
- Text: "Analyzing with AWS Bedrock..."
- Position: Lower third

**[2:15-2:20]** "Repository Scanner"
- Text: "Analyze Entire GitHub Repos"
- Position: Lower third

**[2:45-2:50]** "Built on AWS"
- Text: "Bedrock • Lambda • Amplify"
- Position: Lower third

### Step 6: Add Zoom/Highlight Effects (Optional)

**When to use:**
- Highlighting small UI elements (badges, confidence scores)
- Drawing attention to specific vulnerabilities
- Showing tab navigation

**How to add:**
1. Find the moment in timeline
2. Add keyframe at start
3. Add keyframe at end
4. Increase scale between keyframes (105-110%)
5. Keep duration short (1-2 seconds)

### Step 7: Add Background Music (Optional)

**Music Selection:**
- Subtle, non-distracting
- Tech/corporate style
- No lyrics
- Royalty-free

**Free Music Sources:**
- YouTube Audio Library
- Incompetech (Kevin MacLeod)
- Bensound
- Free Music Archive

**How to add:**
1. Import music file
2. Drag to audio track below video
3. Reduce volume to 10-20% (very quiet)
4. Fade in at start (2 seconds)
5. Fade out at end (2 seconds)
6. Ensure voice is always clearly audible

**⚠️ Important:** Music should be barely noticeable, just filling silence

### Step 8: Add End Card (2:55-3:00)

**Content:**
```
🛡️ AURALIS

Try it: [YOUR_LIVE_URL]
GitHub: github.com/yourusername/auralis

Built with AWS Bedrock, Lambda & Amplify
```

**Design:**
- Same style as title card
- Include call-to-action
- Show URLs clearly
- Duration: 5 seconds

### Step 9: Color Correction (Optional)

If video looks washed out or too dark:
1. Adjust brightness (+5 to +10)
2. Adjust contrast (+5 to +10)
3. Adjust saturation (+5 to +10)
4. Keep changes subtle

### Step 10: Audio Enhancement

**Normalize Audio:**
- Ensures consistent volume throughout
- Most editors: Audio → Normalize

**Remove Background Noise:**
- If available, use noise reduction filter
- Be subtle, don't make voice sound robotic

**Adjust Volume:**
- Voice should be clear and prominent
- Background music should be barely audible
- No clipping (red peaks in audio meter)

- Match audio levels across cuts

### Cursor Highlighting
- Add a colored circle around cursor for important clicks
- Use sparingly, only for key actions

### Picture-in-Picture

### Captions/Subtitles
- Add for accessibility
- Use auto-caption tools (YouTube, Kapwing)
- Review and correct any errors

### B-Roll Inserts
- Cut away to screenshots of news articles during hook

**Problem:** Can't add text overlays
**Solution:** Use simpler editor or add text in post with online tool

- Simple is better than over-produced
- Clear audio is more important than fancy effects
